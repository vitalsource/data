## Description

Integrating formative practice questions with textbook content has
been shown to significantly enhance student learning. However, the
creation of these questions is labor-intensive and costly. Automatic
question generation (AQG) offers a promising solution to scale
formative practice efficiently.

This dataset supports our large-scale evaluation of textbook-based AQG
across six college courses, where automatically generated (AG)
questions were used alongside human-authored (HA)
questions. Performance metrics include engagement, difficulty, and
persistence, capturing how students interacted with these formative
questions.
