Environments: An Evaluation of Textbook-Based Automatic Question
Generation. *** TODO: ADD REST OF REFERENCE ***

The paper was presented at the [Third Workshop on Intelligent Textbooks
(iTextbooks)](https://intextbooks.science.uu.nl/workshop2021/), part
of the [22nd Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence in
Education](https://aied2021.science.uu.nl/).

## Abstract

Textbooks have been the traditional method of providing learning
content to students for decades, and therefore have become the
standard in high-quality content. Yet the static textbook format is
unable to take advantage of the cognitive and learning science
research on effective interactive learning methods.  This gap between
quality content and highly efficient methods of learning can be closed
with advances in artificial intelligence. This paper will
contextualize the need for improving textbooks as a learning resource
using research-based cognitive and learning science methods, and
describe a process by which artificial intelligence transforms
textbooks into more effective online learning environments.  The goal
of this paper is to evaluate textbook-based automatic question
generation using student data from a variety of natural learning
environments. We believe this analysis, based on 786,242 total
observations of student-question interactions, is the largest
evaluation of automatically generated questions using performance
metrics and student data from natural learning contexts known to date,
and will provide valuable insights into how automatic question
generation can continue to enhance content. The implications for this
integration of textbook content and learning science for effective
learning at scale will be discussed.
