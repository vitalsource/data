# VitalSource Supplemental Data Repository

This repository contains supporting data sets and analysis code for
several of our papers where we evaluate the use of [automatic question
generation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9886210/) as
a way to add formative practice to electronic textbooks at a large
scale. To date, millions of automatically generated questions have
been added to thousands of textbooks in the VitalSource Bookshelf
ereader platform and are available to millions of students as a free
study feature called
[CoachMe](https://www.vitalsource.com/coach-me). CoachMe is based on
the [Doer
Effect](https://research.vitalsource.com/research/doer-effect), the
learning science principle that students who do practice as they read
have better learning outcomes than those who only read. All of our
published research papers can be found on our [research
site](https://research.vitalsource.com).
